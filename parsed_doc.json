The presence of candle holders suggests a functional as well as decorative purpose.",

Create a maker wishlist registry so non-experts can easily shop for the experts in a more personal way than a gift card. Assort themed collections for Christmas Eve boxes, kindness jars, and customized gift baskets and group gifts.\n\n02  \nCELEBRATE  \nHoliday gifting is a genuine expression of appreciation and care from the giver to the recipient, and can form and enrich social bonds.\n\nACTION PLAN: Position crafting as a gift of shared experiences. Assort entry level to expert level craft kits.
