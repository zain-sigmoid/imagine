NAPKIN_TEMPLATE: |
  Create a premium paper napkin that combines artistic illustration with elegant finishing, inspired by hand-painted watercolor and modern vector styles. The design should be versatile, print-ready, and themed for {theme_label}.

  Primary Design Concept
  - Central motif: {motif} with a {background_treatment} background.
  - Composition: single focal composition, uncluttered.
    • Artwork coverage: target ~{coverage_target} of the canvas.
    • Keep at least {min_margin_each_side} clean margin on each side; corners must remain empty.
    • Do not fill edges; no all-over pattern; no heavy emboss.
  - Metallic detail: {metallic_finish} (thin, subtle).

  Style & Inspiration
  - Illustration Style: {illustration_style}.
  - Botanical Motifs: {botanical_motifs}.

  Color Palette Strategy
  - Base tones: {base_tones}.

  - Balance: 80% background (soft neutral/pastel), 15% motif/illustration, 5% metallic & accents.

  Decorative Elements
  - Florals/Leaves: {decorative_florals}; keep to maximum {max_floral_clusters} clusters total.
  - Icons: {decorative_icons}; icons count ≤ {max_icon_count}.
  - Borders: {border_style}. Keep rim thin and clean; avoid filling with florals.
  - Negative Space: leave at least 30–40% of canvas empty background.

  Typography (Optional)
  - Use typography: {use_typography}.
  - Copy (if any): "{typography_copy}".
  - Type style: {typography_style}. Placement: {typography_placement}. Color: {typography_color}.

  Production Specs (treat as constraints, not literal text)
  - Resolution: 300 DPI minimum (upscale if needed), export vector-like crispness.
  - Color Mode: CMYK-friendly rendering with separate gold foiling layer indication.
  - Safe zones: Keep center motif within 5mm of plate edge; include 3mm bleed.
  - Material: Compatible with paperboard + eco-friendly substrates.
  - Finish: {finish_spec}.

  Format & Output
  - Aspect: {aspect}. Size: {size_hint}. Quality: {quality_hint}.
  - Deliver a clean, high-contrast scene suitable for print; no watermark, no brand text.
